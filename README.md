## Why DBML?

DBML (Database Markup Language) is an open-source DSL language designed to define and document database schemas and structures. It is designed to be simple, consistent and highly-readable.

This project aims to make use of DBML as a language for writing SeaORM entity.

## The taste

Below is the example of transpiling DBML into SeaORM entity.

```dbml
Table user {
  id integer [pk]
  username varchar
  role varchar
}
```

```rust
//! Generated by sea-orm-dbml 0.1.0

pub mod user {
  use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

  #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel)]
  #[sea_orm(table_name = "user", schema_name = "public")]
  pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(column_type = "Integer", primary_key, auto_increment = false)]
    pub id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(column_type = "String(None)")]
    pub username: String,
    #[sea_orm(column_type = "String(None)")]
    pub role: String,
  }

  #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, DeriveRelation)]
  pub enum Relation {}

  impl ActiveModelBehavior for ActiveModel {}
}

```

## How to use it?
